Details for Competency AIC-304 (Neural Networks and Deep Learning)

IDENTITY CODE: DEEP_LEARNING_4
REQUIRED? true
CREDITS: 4 (Graded)
DESCRIPTION
This competency introduces the core concepts behind so called "deep learning" models, which use a series of many layers to extract features and patterns from a set of input data. The main focus is on convolutional neural networks, important for computer vision and related classification tasks.
