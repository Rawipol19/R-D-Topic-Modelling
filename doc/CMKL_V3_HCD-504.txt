Details for Competency HCD-504 (Psychology for User Interface Design )

IDENTITY CODE: PSYCH_FOR_UI_4
REQUIRED? false
CREDITS: 4 (Graded)
DESCRIPTION
Linking an understanding human perception, bias, and behavior to the design principles and strategies of digital production is a key element in modern user-centered design. This course will cover the following key concepts towards integrating core theories in psychology with desirable outcomes in design:

- Understanding tendencies in human perception (visual, auditory, and tactile)
- Recognizing the key role of attention in design thinking
- Identifying common cognitive biases with both perception and behavior
- Designing around emotions (and not simply pragmatism)
- Employing mechanics to drive human motivation
- Avoiding cognitive load through understanding information processing

This course drives an understanding of human psychology as it informs design outcomes, while also contributing to more ethical engineering standards.
