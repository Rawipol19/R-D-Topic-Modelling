Details for Competency AIC-201 (Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning)

IDENTITY CODE: SUP_UNSUP_ML_4
REQUIRED? true
CREDITS: 4 (Graded)
DESCRIPTION
This competency introduces fundamental machine learning concepts including models, supervised versus unsupervised techniques, training versus testing data, data bias, and so on. Students have the opportunity to build traditional unsupervised versus supervised models on sample data sets as well as to explore basic neural networks.

	ASSESSMENT TYPE: Hands-on problem    
	ASSESSMENT TITLE: Assessment: Understanding fundamental ML concepts
	ASSESSMENT DESCRIPTION: Find and explain an example of machine learning in the literature, discussing and evaluating the example in terms of concepts such as data dimensions, supervised versus unsupervised techniques, etc.
	COMPLEXITY LEVEL:Analyze                 


SKILL CODE: AIC-201:00020   
	KNOWLEDGE TOPIC: Unsupervised learning methods                               
	ASSESSMENT TYPE: Hands-on problem    
	ASSESSMENT TITLE: Assessment: Applying unsupervised learning methods
