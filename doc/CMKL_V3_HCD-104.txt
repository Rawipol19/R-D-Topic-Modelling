Details for Competency HCD-104 (Immersive Environment (AR/VR/MR/XR))

IDENTITY CODE: IMMERSIVE_ENV_6
REQUIRED? false
CREDITS: 6 (Graded)
DESCRIPTION
Immersive environments are simulations in which computer-generated imagery and other stimuli are combined with the experience of the real world, to engage the senses of users through real-time 3D graphics, audio, and interaction. Depending on the amount of real/physical versus simulated/generated material, the results can be labeled as Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), or Mixed Reality (MR). There is also Extended Reality (XR) that is a collective/umbrella term for various forms of immersive environments. This is a competency in both the theory and practice of immersive environments that are used in a variety of settings, including training, education, healthcare, entertainment, online collaboration and scientific visualization. You will have the opportunity to learn about the basics and key concepts of immersive environments and how to get started creating content and designing interfaces and developing interactions, followed by deployment on headsets and mobile devices.

SKILL CODE: HCD-104:00050   
	KNOWLEDGE TOPIC: Interfaces, Actions, Interactions, Input/output             
	ASSESSMENT TYPE: Imported assessment 
	ASSESSMENT TITLE: Assessment: Create an interactive immersive environment in a game engine (e.g., Unity) containing game objects, 3D models, and an animated character that uses physics and AI path-finding (e.g., Unity NavMeshAgent) to move towards a destination point specified by the user's mouse click.
	ASSESSMENT DESCRIPTION: Create an interactive immersive environment in a game engine (e.g., Unity) including game objects, lights, textures, animations, basic physics interactions (jumping, collision, etc) that has at least one 3D model imported from Blender as .fbx file as well as a character imported from Mixamo and then via scripting and NavMeshAgent, get your character to move towards a destination point when you click somewhere in the scene. You will be quizzed on how you set up the project and how you wrote the NavMeshAgent script.
