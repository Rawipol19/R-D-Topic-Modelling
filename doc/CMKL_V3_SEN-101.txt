IDENTITY CODE: ALGO_THINKING_2
REQUIRED? true
CREDITS: 2 (Graded)
DESCRIPTION
This competency gives students practice in analyzing a problem, determining a solution and expressing that solution in terms of operations that can be executed by a computer program. It also introduces common notations for expressing algorithms, such as flowcharts and pseud-ocode, as well as analysis strategies like successive refinement.
