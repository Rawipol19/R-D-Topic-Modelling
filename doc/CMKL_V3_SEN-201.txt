Details for Competency SEN-201 (Software Engineering Processes)

IDENTITY CODE: SE_PROCESSES_6
REQUIRED? true
CREDITS: 6 (Graded)
DESCRIPTION
This competency introduces the underlying goals of software engineering, namely to reduce complexity, increase predictability and improve software quality. It then provides a survey of the most fundamental software engineering processes that teams employ in order to achieve these goals. This is a project based course. Assessment will be based on activities and artifacts generate by each project team.

	ASSESSMENT TYPE: Hands-on problem    
	ASSESSMENT TITLE: Assessment: Software testing        
	ASSESSMENT DESCRIPTION: Given an actual software system, create a functional test plan you could use to verify that the system performs as specified. Then execute the test plan and document the results.
	COMPLEXITY LEVEL:Create                  


SKILL CODE: SEN-201:00070   
	KNOWLEDGE TOPIC: Deployment and maintenance                                  
	ASSESSMENT TYPE: Hands-on problem    
	ASSESSMENT TITLE: Assessment: Deployment and maintenance
