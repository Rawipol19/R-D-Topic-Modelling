Details for Competency HCD-403 (Narrative Design)

IDENTITY CODE: NARRATIVE_DESIGN_6
REQUIRED? false
CREDITS: 6 (Graded)
DESCRIPTION
Digital storytelling, in both gaming and interactive digital media more broadly, requires a thorough understanding of the architecture of a narrative. Narrative allows players, users, and customers to project themselves into an experience, and this is achieved through a carefully designed user experience (UX). This course will cover narrative conception/ideation, storyboarding, narrative design modeling, production tracking, dialogue writing, variable-driven user choices (i.e. interactive design), and user testing.
