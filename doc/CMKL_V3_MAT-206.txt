+++ SKILLS AND ASSESSMENTS +++



SKILL CODE: MAT-206:00010   
	KNOWLEDGE TOPIC: Estimation                                                  
	ASSESSMENT TYPE: Hands-on problem    
	ASSESSMENT TITLE: Punctual, interval and regional estimation
	ASSESSMENT DESCRIPTION: Given a sample from a Normal distribution compute: punctual estimators for its mean and variance; maximum likelihood of the parameters, and confidence intervals and regions for a specified significance level. Also compute a prediction interval for a future observation.
	COMPLEXITY LEVEL:Understand              


SKILL CODE: MAT-206:00020   
	KNOWLEDGE TOPIC: Hypothesis Test                                             
	ASSESSMENT TYPE: Hands-on problem    
	ASSESSMENT TITLE: Hypothesis testing for mean, variance, and ANOVA
	ASSESSMENT DESCRIPTION: Given data from different populations, if the appropriate assumptions are satisfied, perform hypothesis tests on the mean, and variance. Also perform an ANOVA to determine if the means can be considered equal.
	COMPLEXITY LEVEL:Apply                   


SKILL CODE: MAT-206:00030   
	KNOWLEDGE TOPIC: Linear Regression                                           
	ASSESSMENT TYPE: Hands-on problem    
	ASSESSMENT TITLE: Adjust and analyze a linear regression model
	ASSESSMENT DESCRIPTION: Given a variable of interest and covariates, perform and analyze a linear regression. Including the analysis of the assumptions and the creation of appropriate plots and figures.
	COMPLEXITY LEVEL:Analyze
