Details for Competency SEC-402 (Differential Privacy (DP))

IDENTITY CODE: DIFF_PRIVACY_6
REQUIRED? false
CREDITS: 6 (Graded)
DESCRIPTION
Differential privacy is a privacy preservation technique that leverages the benefit of small changes to ensure minimal exposure of data characteristics. In this competency, you will explore various technical background behind the differential privacy technique. Also, the application beyond the mathematical foundation will be discussed in detail.
