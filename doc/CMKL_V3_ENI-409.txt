DESCRIPTION
Game content monetisation and tokenomics involve generating revenue from in-game assets and experiences using digital tokens. Monetization strategies include in-app purchases, subscriptions, and advertising. Tokenomics refers to the economic system governing the creation, distribution, and management of digital tokens within a game, often leveraging blockchain technology. These tokens can represent in-game currency, assets, or collectibles that players can buy, sell, or trade. Effective tokenomics ensures a balanced and sustainable economy, incentivizing player engagement and investment. This approach allows developers to create new revenue streams while enhancing player experience through ownership and trading of unique digital assets.
