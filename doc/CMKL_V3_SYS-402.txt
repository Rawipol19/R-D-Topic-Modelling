Details for Competency SYS-402 (Distributed Data Storage)

IDENTITY CODE: DISTRIB_DATA_4
REQUIRED? false
CREDITS: 4 (Graded)
DESCRIPTION
Storages are one of the most vital components of computer systems. They often dominate the performance of a system, and failures of other components are frequently addressed by restarting from the data stored on them. However, when data is growing, the data storage needs to be scalable and potentially be distributed.

This competency covers the design, implementation, and use of storage and file systems, from the characteristics and operation of individual storage devices to the operating system, and networking approaches involved in tying them together and making them useful in servers and large-scale distributed systems.

+++ SKILLS AND ASSESSMENTS +++



SKILL CODE: SYS-402:00010   
	KNOWLEDGE TOPIC: Multiple-disk system                                        
	ASSESSMENT TYPE: Hands-on problem    
	ASSESSMENT TITLE: Create a multiple-disk system       
	ASSESSMENT DESCRIPTION: Students will be given a task to analyze several workloads and design a multiple disk system to satisfy their requirements. Moreover, students will implement a simple software RAID program to demonstrate their understanding on multiple-disk systems.
	COMPLEXITY LEVEL:Analyze                 


SKILL CODE: SYS-402:00020   
	KNOWLEDGE TOPIC: Distributed file system                                     
	ASSESSMENT TYPE: Hands-on problem    
	ASSESSMENT TITLE: Create a distributed data storage   
	ASSESSMENT DESCRIPTION: Students must be able to implement a basic distributed system with a cache coherence protocol (from either Sprite, NFSv3, or AFSv2) along with an atomicity mechanism (e.g., write-ahead logging, shadow paging).
	COMPLEXITY LEVEL:Understand              


SKILL CODE: SYS-402:00030   
	KNOWLEDGE TOPIC: Large-scale data storage                                    
	ASSESSMENT TYPE: Hands-on problem    
	ASSESSMENT TITLE: Create a highly scalable distributed data storage
	ASSESSMENT DESCRIPTION: Students must be able implement a decentralized data storage with a consensus protocol (e.g., 2-phase commit, Raft).
	COMPLEXITY LEVEL:Understand
