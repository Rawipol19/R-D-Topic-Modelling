Details for Competency SYS-205 (Storage and File Systems Fundamentals)

IDENTITY CODE: FILE_SYSTEMS_2
REQUIRED? false
CREDITS: 2 (Graded)
DESCRIPTION
Many useful applications (e.g., deep learning, data mining, video editing) require data that usually exceed the capacity of main memory (e.g., SRAM, DRAM) in many computer systems. Without additional storage devices (i.e., secondary storage), computer systems would not support those applications. However, computer systems should also handle those devices efficiently in order to maximize applications' performance while ensuring data integrity according to how users generally use them.

This competency will equip you with skills to understand and be able to apply the knowledge of how computer systems are designed and implemented to interact with persistent storage devices (i.e., hard disk drives, solid state drives) efficiently. This includes device management, basic file system operations, and basic file system designs and implementations.
