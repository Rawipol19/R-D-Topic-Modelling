Details for Competency AIC-403 (Classification and Regression)

IDENTITY CODE: CLASS_REGRESS_6
REQUIRED? false
CREDITS: 4 (Graded)
DESCRIPTION
In this class, students will learn about classification and regression which are the main pillars of data science. While this course covers well-known state-of-the-art algorithms and their concepts, it is heavily focused on the real-world applications of classification and regression. Some of the covered algorithms are XGBoost, Random Forest, ARIMA, and YOLO (but not limited to).  There are short writing assignments and a final project at the end. Lab sessions will be conducted in Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.
