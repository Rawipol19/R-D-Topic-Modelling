Details for Competency SEN-401 (Agile Development Processes (including DevOps))

IDENTITY CODE: AGILE_SE_2
REQUIRED? false
CREDITS: 2 (Graded)
DESCRIPTION
Agile Development refers to a software development style which emphasizes self-organization of team work, fluid design, frequent iteration and visibility of status. An agile approach contrasts with more formal and rigid development process paradigms which attempt to fully document the requirements and design of a system before implementation begins. This competency will review several agile paradigms and give students the opportunity to experiment with their practices.
