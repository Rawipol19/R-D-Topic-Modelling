Details for Competency ENI-108 (CAD Lab)

IDENTITY CODE: CAD_LAB_4
REQUIRED? false
CREDITS: 4 (Graded)
DESCRIPTION
CAD (Computer-Aided Design) engineering involves the use of software to create, modify, analyze, or optimize designs. It is widely used in fields like architecture, automotive, aerospace, and manufacturing. CAD allows engineers and designers to develop precise 2D and 3D models, visualize concepts, and simulate real-world conditions, enabling better decision-making early in the design process. It improves productivity by automating many design tasks, reduces errors, and enhances collaboration across teams. CAD tools also support computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) and product lifecycle management (PLM), ensuring seamless integration from design to production.
