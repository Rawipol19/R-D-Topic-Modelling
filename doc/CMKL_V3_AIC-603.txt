Details for Competency AIC-603 (Autonomous Agents)

IDENTITY CODE: AUTO_AGENTS_4
REQUIRED? false
CREDITS: 4 (Graded)
OPTION GROUP: AI Applications

DESCRIPTION
Autonomous agent applications involving multiple independent AI models or entities that cooperate to perform some task or solve some problem. Autonomous agents may be embodied as robotic entities or may be software only, depending on the task. This competency introduces the core concepts in an autonomous agent system as well as principles for designing and evaluating them.
