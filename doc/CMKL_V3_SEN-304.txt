Details for Competency SEN-304 (Object Oriented Design and Programming)

IDENTITY CODE: OO_PROG_6
REQUIRED? false
CREDITS: 6 (Graded)
DESCRIPTION
Core principles of the object-oriented paradigm including classes and instances, member data and methods, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, separation of concerns, etc. Students will work in pairs to create a UML-based design for a simple object-oriented system, then implement it in Java. Because this is a project-based class, all work must be completed by the end of the semester. It will not be possible to extend this competency.
