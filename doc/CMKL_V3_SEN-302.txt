Details for Competency SEN-302 (Designing and Building Mission Critical Software)

IDENTITY CODE: MISSION_CRITICAL_SW_2
REQUIRED? false
CREDITS: 2 (Graded)
DESCRIPTION
"Mission critical" software is software with extremely high requirements for availability and correctness. Failures in mission critical software are likely to result in death or disasters. Examples include power-grid software, software embedded in medical devices and software used in space technology. Teams developing mission-critical software need to adopt processes that will allow them to meet these more stringent requirements.
