Details for Competency AIC-402 (Proximity Measurement and Cluster Analysis)

IDENTITY CODE: CLUSTER_ANALYSIS_4
REQUIRED? false
CREDITS: 4 (Graded)
DESCRIPTION
Proximity measures are mathematical techniques that calculate the similarity/dissimilarity of data points. Cluster analysis is a technique to group similar observations into a number of clusters based on the observed values of several variables for each individual.
