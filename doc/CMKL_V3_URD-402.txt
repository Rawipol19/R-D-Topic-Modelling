CREDITS: 12 (Graded)
DESCRIPTION
The undergraduate research thesis competency requires students to engage in independent, original research that addresses some documented problem in the computing or engineering literature. After performing a thorough literature review, students will do theoretical, experimental or prototype development work that is expected to produce some new knowledge or insights about the problem. The primary deliverable is a formal document comparable to a master's thesis. Publication in a peer-reviewed journal or conference proceedings may be accepted as an alternative deliverable if approved by the student's research supervisor.  Students interested in the honors thesis must register fro both URD-401 and URD-402.
