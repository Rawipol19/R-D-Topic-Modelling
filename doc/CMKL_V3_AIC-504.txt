Details for Competency AIC-504 (Simulation)

IDENTITY CODE: SIMULATION_4
REQUIRED? false
CREDITS: 4 (Graded)
DESCRIPTION
This competency explores various methods for building an executable model that mimics the behavior of some real world system. We consider different types of models: deterministic versus stochastic, monolithic versus agent-based, classical versus AI-powered (based on deep learning models). Students will learn how to analyze real-world systems, choose appropriate simulation techniques and build simulation models using those techniques.

SKILL CODE: AIC-504:00030   
	KNOWLEDGE TOPIC: Digital twins                                               
	ASSESSMENT TYPE: Hands-on problem    
	ASSESSMENT TITLE: Understand and apply the concept of digital twins
	ASSESSMENT DESCRIPTION: Find a detailed description in the literature of a digital twin. Analyze this system from the perspective of simulation, highlighting both the benefits and the issues raised.
	COMPLEXITY LEVEL:Analyze                 


SKILL CODE: AIC-504:00040   
	KNOWLEDGE TOPIC: AI and simulation                                           
	ASSESSMENT TYPE: Hands-on problem    
	ASSESSMENT TITLE: Design a simulation that uses AI techniques
	ASSESSMENT DESCRIPTION: Create a design document that explains how you would build an AI-based simulation to model some specific system. This skill involves not only figuring out the issues and steps in building the AI-based simulation, but also the ability to recognize when a particular problem or real-world system would benefit from an AI-based simulation approach.
