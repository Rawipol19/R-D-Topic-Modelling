Details for Competency COM-108 (Academic Writing & Research)

IDENTITY CODE: ACADEMIC_WRITING
REQUIRED? false
CREDITS: 8 (Graded)
DESCRIPTION
This 8-credit competency is designed to prepare students interested in the pursuit of graduate-level education through refining the research, sourcing, writing, and critical thinking skills. This competency emphasizes the basic principles of critical reading and research, logic, rhetoric, grammar, writing, and conceptual defense.

This includes critical evaluation, thesis development, data-driven objective analysis, and the typical structure and expectations of academic publishing. This competency demands a well-sourced and well-structured academic thesis as an outcome, which will be assessed directly by an advisor on a one-to-one basis. The student will also be expected to defend this thesis in front of a small faculty panel. 

This course will include 4 formal lectures every third week, with one-to-one consultation with the professor for the two weeks between lectures. These one-to-one conversations will be used to develop individual theses, conduct academic research around that thesis, outline the general objectives of the academic paper, and finally to write that paper. As this course has substantial one-to-one advising, there are a limited number of seats available.
